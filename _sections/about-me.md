### Postdoctoral Researcher in Cosmology

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Cosmology, working for the [CosmoStat][cosmostat] group at [CEA Paris-Saclay][cea]. Check out my profile page at CosmoStat:

My main focus of research is Dark Energy and the Large Scale Structure of the Universe.
I am part of the [Euclid][euclid] space satellite collaboration which will survey billions of galaxies in the sky
to try to understand the origin of the accelerated expansion of the Universe.

My more specific areas of interest are: Non-linear structure formation, Galaxy Clustering, Weak Lensing, Bayesian Statistics, Fisher Matrix Forecasts, Modified Gravity and Scalar Field Theories of Dark Energy, Neutrinos and Machine Learning for Parameter Estimation and Emulation.

You can find some more details about my research projects in the Publications page.
More about my career path on my [CV]({% link cv.md %}).


### PhD in Theoretical Physics and Cosmology

After finishing my Bachelor in Physics at the University of Costa Rica, I moved to Germany to start a Master's Degree in Theoretical Physics
at the [Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg][unihd].
I liked it so much there, that I stayed to pursue my PhD in Theoretical Physics and Cosmology at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics][itphd].

If you would like to know more about my biography, check the first episode of our [Podcastination](https://anchor.fm/cosmic-sloth/episodes/Catch-me-if-you-can-ed3u0d) podcast,
where Sam and Fadi interviewed me and we also discuss about the daily life and work of researchers.

### Other Interests



Since my freshman years at college, I became very interested in Linux and Open Source software.
You can check my [GitHub]({{- site.github_url -}})
repository to find out more about projects and codes I have worked on.

I am also a long time user of the [Mathematica][wolfmath] software, whose engine finally became
freely available for developers.
Since high school and thanks to my excellent math teacher, who was a contributor to the [Demonstrations Project][wolfdemo], I have always admired all the [science][wolfscience] and the knowledge that is available within
the [Wolfram Language][wolflang] ecosystem.

Recently I have been improving my Python programming skills and have been teaching some tutorials which you can
find on the CosmoStat's Python Tutorial website
<a href="https://github.com/CosmoStat/Tutorials/tree/python" class="icon-b fa-python"><span class="label">Python Tutorials</span></a>
and on the CosmoStat's YouTube channel
<a href="https://youtu.be/cbekcGxm70Q" class="icon-b fa-youtube"><span class="label">YouTube</span></a>

I also write sometimes some blog posts on Medium
<a href="https://medium.com/@santiagocasas" class="icon-b fa-medium"><span class="label">Medium</span></a>
 about data science, cosmology, politics or cryptocurrencies.

 Regarding cryptocurrencies, I have been very interested in the field of blockchain and tokenization
 in the past two years. There is not much I can show now, but I will write soon about my experience so far in the
 [blog]({% link blog.html%}) within this website.
