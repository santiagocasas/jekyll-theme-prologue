### Postdoctoral Researcher in Cosmology

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Cosmology, working for the [CosmoStat][cosmostat] group at [CEA Paris-Saclay][cea].

Check out my profile page at CosmoStat:

My main focus of research is Dark Energy and the Large Scale Structure of the Universe.
I am part of the [Euclid][euclid] space satellite collaboration which will survey billions of galaxies in the sky
to try to understand the origin of the accelerated expansion of the Universe.

My more specific areas of interest are: Non-linear structure formation, Galaxy Clustering, Weak Lensing, Bayesian Statistics, Fisher Matrix Forecasts, Modified Gravity and Scalar Field Theories of Dark Energy, Neutrinos and Machine Learning for Parameter Estimation and Emulation.

You can find some more details about my research projects in the Publications page.

### PhD in Theoretical Physics and Cosmology

After finishing my Bachelor in Physics at the University of Costa Rica, I moved to Germany to start a Master's Degree in Theoretical Physics
at the [Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg][unihd].
I liked it so much there, that I stayed to pursue my PhD in Theoretical Physics and Cosmology at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics][itphd].

### Other Interests

Since my freshman years at college, I became very interested in Linux and Open Source software. You can check my Github repository to find out more about projects and codes I have worked on.

I am also a great fan of the Wolfram Mathematica software and all the science and tools available within its ecosystem.

Recently I have been improving my Python programming skills and have been teaching some tutorials which you can find on the CosmoStat's Python Tutorial website and on the CosmoStat's YouTube channel.
